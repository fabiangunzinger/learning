# Python basics

## Motivation

I want to be fluent in carrying out basic Python data tasks and want to understand the key concepts (e.g. APIs, philosophies) that underlie the tools I
use for this purpose.

In particular, I want to build fluency in:
- Writing Pythonic code
- Pandas
- Data visualisation in Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Altair
- Object oriented programming
- Functional programming
- Testing

As a next step, I then want to move on to causal analysis and, after that, machine learning:

- Basic statistics in Python
- Causal analysis in Python
- Scikit-learn


## Goal

Explore mdb data for PhD in best-practice fashion and master basic Pandas operations such that I do to the data whatever I want without having to google much and without producing errors.


## Timeline

The goal is to get through the end of the Pandas syllabus below by the end of February, and then move on to further topics in March. In mid Feb, I'll start reflecting on progress so far and start develop the new curriculum.


## Learning approach

To explore and get familiar with the data I use for my PhD I'll try explore everything in the syllabus directly in the notebook I use for working with this data.
